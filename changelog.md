* Fixed crash when deleting text in the chat or anvil screen with the inverted font enabled
* Added a config option for disabling font conversions depending on a regex. By default, this prevents fonts from being used when typing in commands. ([#72](https://github.com/replaceitem/symbol-chat/issues/72))
* Added a config option to toggle whether the selected font should stay selected across restarts.
* Selecting a font now selects the text box.
